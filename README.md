## 📌 Problem Statement

AtliQ Market is on a promising journey, serving customers in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. With ambitions to expand across more metro cities within the next two years, the company is encountering a challenge. Some critical products haven't been delivered on time or in full, potentially leading to detrimental customer experiences. The management is determined to rectify this issue before venturing into new territories.

## 🎯 My Task

As the appointed data analyst, I embarked on a mission to create a dashboard that would provide a comprehensive overview of key metrics related to delivery performance and inventory management. This dashboard aimed to highlight trends and anomalies, enabling the management to make informed decisions and drive operational improvements.

## 🟢 Major Key Metrics

To focus our analysis, I selected the following major key metrics that would be pivotal in evaluating the delivery performance and supply chain efficiency:

- **OT % (On-Time Delivery Percentage):** The percentage of deliveries made on time.
- **IF % (In Full Delivery Percentage):** The percentage of deliveries made in full.
- **OTIF % (On-Time and In Full Delivery Percentage):** The percentage of deliveries made both on time and in full.
- **LIFR (Line Fill Rate):** The proportion of orders filled without any missing items.
- **VOFR (Volume Fill Rate):** The proportion of total ordered volume fulfilled.

## 📝 Learnings and Insights

During the course of this project, I gained valuable insights and knowledge:

- Deepened understanding of the FMCG (Supply Chain) domain and its intricacies.
- Recognized the paramount significance of customer satisfaction and its cascading impact on the business.
- Familiarized myself with supply chain terminologies, including OT%, IF%, OTIF%, LIFR%, and VOFR%.
- Mastered the art of utilizing sparklines to effectively visualize trends and utilized DAX functions to highlight months with exceptional values.
- Leveraged dynamic switch buttons to dynamically alter the displayed charts, facilitating an interactive user experience.
